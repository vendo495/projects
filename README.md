Facial Recognition: 
  This project is part of completing the Advanced DeepLearning and ComputerVision course. 
        I was asked to develop a face recognition program with a deep convolution neural network using Keras.
        Tasks performed:
          Normalizing all the images
          Splitting the datasets
          Transforming
          The CNN model consists of 3 main layers:
            1. Convolution layer
            2. Pooling layer
            3. Fully Connected layer
        The model has been iterated with an accuracy above 90%
        The result was plotted for model accuracy and model loss
